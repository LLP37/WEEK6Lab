I wrote our own Code of Conduct for this project, because it is such 
a small project and I thought writing our own would allow it to be more 
specific to the project. In the first section, I thanked the user for using/contributing
to our project and let our values of ensuring the safety and comfort of our users be known. 
In the next part, I said the four big rules that our project has. For the first two, you need to 
enter your real age and name, so that we can ensure that we are giving you the right information 
and that no slurs, etc. are being written in the name slot. Next, in the third rule I ensured that 
slurs are not allowed especially in the name slot where people might be tempted to write bad words. 
Lastly, I wrote that contributors should not write sections asking users for their gender or sexual orientation, 
so that users can maintain their privacy and won't feel uncomfortable and that they are being asked to overshare 
when those are not relevant to asking them to go out and vote! Finally, in the last section I stated what would happen 
if they did not follow the COC, based on what I learned in the Week 7 Lab Lesson.
