# WEEK6Lab
This lab will allow us to create a mini program and test out VCS.

The program we produced for the following lab week involves a user's name and age being input. The purpose of the program revolves around a person's ability to vote. The goal of the program is to get young people to look forward to voting by telling them how many years until they are able to (in other words, when they turn 18) or to encourage those of voting age to go out and do their civic duty. Thus, when a user inputs their age and name, the program will return a customized message back to them. 

The program works by taking in an integer input (user_age) and a string input (user_name) and running them through two if statements. If the user's age is less than 18, the program will subtract their age from 18 to tell them how many years they have until they can legally vote. If they are above 18, it will simply print a statment telling them to go vote. 

To contribute to this code, pull requests can be made through a JupyterLab terminal to LLP37 through WEEK6Lab. Improvements to this code would potentially be error-proofing it if one were to enter a non-integer in the user_age input. One could also utilize this code and improve it to be used in advertising to young voters (or any voters) to get them out there on election day.
