# WEEK6Lab
This lab will allow us to create a mini program and test out VCS.
18
Our program asks for the user's name and age. If the user's age is less than 18, it tells the user how many more years until they turn 18. If they are older than 18 years old and younger than 65, then the program tells them to go vote! If they are older than 65 years old, the program thanks them for voting all these years.

Group Members: Lydon Pelletier, Leah-Rose Sellinger, and Tegan Lapp
